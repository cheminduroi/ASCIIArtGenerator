# ASCII Art Generator

As a little exercise, I decided that I would build each project in the article [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/), using a different language for each project. This is the 1<sup>st</sup> project in the article, built in node.js. The program converts an image into ascii art (you might have to play with the terminal dimensions a bit to see the resulting image properly).
